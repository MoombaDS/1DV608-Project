# Vision Document

## Introduction

This component is a simple quiz component which will allow registered users to create quizzes with an arbitrary number of questions. Other users will be able to take these quizzes and their scores will be calculated and recorded. These stats can be viewed to see how well people perform on individual quizzes or how well an individual has performed across multiple quizzes.

## Business Needs/Requirements

Quizzes form a simple and efficient way to deduce the level of knowledge an individual has on any given subject. They can also provide an entertaining pastime. This system is intended to give users a way to easily create and take quizzes with as little hassle as possible and give them access to basic stats relating to their performance and the quizzes they have created.

## Solution Overview

This component will be a PHP based web application which provides a platform for the creation of any number of quizzes featuring any type of question. Once quizzes have been created they can be taken by any number of individuals, whose scores will be recorded for the creator and individual to view at their leisure. Individuals will only be able to take each quiz once and creators will not be able to take their own quizzes.
